Troubleshooting
===============

Something didn't work right? Here are some common problems with their solutions.

........
   
The Homebrew Menu doesn't show anything!
----------------------------------------

This is usually due to an archive metadata bit used by some OS's that Horizon simply can't deal with. Here's how to fix it:

1. Enter Hekate through RCM or PegaScape
2. Select **'Tools > Archive Bit - AutoRCM > Unset archive bit'**

    * This might take a while, be patient.
