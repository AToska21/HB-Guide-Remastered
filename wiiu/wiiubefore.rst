   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Before Starting
===============

This section of the guide will teach you basic information about terminology used, what you will be able to do after following this guide, and provide some warnings before you proceed.

.. important:: 
   This is a lot of info to take in, but if you are a complete noob to the WiiU scene, you should seriously consider reading all of it.

What is Homebrew?
-----------------

Homebrew is a term used to describe software not authorized by Nintendo. This includes custom firmwares, tools, applications, games, emulators, etc.

........

What is Custom Firmware?
------------------------

Custom Firmware (CFW) gives homebrew more access to the system than standard userland homebrew most commonly available on most systems. 

........

What will I get by following this guide?
----------------------------------------

This guide will give you the ability to run a custom (or patched) firmware of choice on a previously unmodified Wii U.

There are 2 ways to accomplish this, you can either run a browser exploit everytime you reboot your Wii U or you can install Haxchi, a permanent exploit taking over a DS title.

You can also install Coldboot Haxchi, **however** this guide will not guide you through that due to multiple issues that Coldboot Haxchi can cause.

.. danger::

	* There is always a chance that your Wii U will brick. This is very rare, and often recoverable, but unrecoverable bricks CAN happen.
	* Follow the guide and everything should be fine.
	
.. note::

	While this guide was written for the newest firmware version, it does theoretically support all firmware versions
