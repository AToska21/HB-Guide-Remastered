Upgrading/Downgrading Manually With a PC
========================================

This guide will teach you how to upgrade or downgrade to any firmware version of your choosing using the ChoiDujour Windows application. **Your Switch does not need to be booting to perform this guide, and as such it is also useful for unbricking a Switch.**

**Read every warning before starting.**

    <div class="admonition danger" style="color:#C42525" align="center">
		<h1 style="margin-bottom:0.5rem;margin-top:0.5rem;font-size:2.5rem">WARNING</h1>
        <h2>Do not follow this guide on an IPATCHED Switch.</h2>
        <p>This guide is only intended to be used on consoles with a vulnerable RCM. It is <b>very very dangerous</b> to follow this guide without the ability to launch payloads via the Switches RCM mode using fusee-gelee.
        <h2 style="margin-bottom:0.5rem">If you cannot run payloads from RCM with fusee-gelee, <b>DO NOT FOLLOW THIS GUIDE.</b></h2>
        <h2>Failure to heed this warning <b>will</b> result in a bricked Switch.</h2>
	</div>

.. note:: 
   If something goes wrong or you need help, check `troubleshooting </troubleshooting.html>`_.
   
.. danger::
    This guide is only intended to be used with RCM. It is **very very dangerous** to follow this guide without the ability to launch payloads via RCM. **Do not follow this guide if you cannot launch RCM payloads!**

.. danger::
    **This guide will likely take you 30-60 minutes to complete if it is your first time.** If you decide to stop half way through, or if anything goes wrong, you must restore your NAND backup that you will create with Hekate to make your Switch work again.
    
.. danger::
    When downgrading across major firmware versions (ex. 7.0.0 -> 6.2.0, 6.1.0 -> 4.1.0), you may be required to lose access to **all user content on your Switch including users, game saves and installed games.** If this turns out to be the case, you will have the option to either restore your Switch back to it's original state, retaining all of your data, or continue with a full wipe to complete the downgrade. This will happen very late in the guide, and as such you may find all of your effort was for nothing if you do not want to lose system data. **Upgrading will never require a wipe, only downgrading.**
    
.. danger::
    **This guide is only for who do not have access to CFW on their latest firmware version and do not have a working NAND backup from a lower firmware version.** If you have access to CFW, follow `Manually Updating/Downgrading </usingcfw/manualupgrade>`_ instead. If you have a working NAND backup, you can restore that with Hekate instead to downgrade to whatever firmware version that NAND backup was made on. In all cases, the side-effects below might still apply.

.. danger::
    **You cannot upgrade or downgrade directly to any firmwares from 6.2.0-9.1.0** as the ChoiDujour PC application does not support these firmware versions. You must upgrade/downgrade to any other firmware version first and then upgrade to these higher firmware versions with the ChoiDujourNX Switch application if you specifically want one of these firmware versions.
    
.. danger::
    This process is very complex and contains many steps. Make sure to read everything carefully, **as any missteps can lead to a bricked Switch.** You have been warned.

.. danger::
    **AutoRCM is required while your Switch is downgraded.** AutoRCM is a software method of forcing your Switch to go into RCM on every launch, without the need of a jig or hardmod. Essentially, you are purposefully bricking your Switch in a controlled matter that forces it to launch into recovery. This might sound scary but is not actually dangerous, and can be undone at any time.

    AutoRCM has the following benefits:

    * You will be able to bypass the normally required fuse count, allowing you to launch any firmware version of your choosing.
    * The Switch will not burn any fuses, meaning you can downgrade your Switch to a lower firmware version in the future should the need arise.
    * You will never accidentally boot stock firmware, meaning you can avoid having telemetry data accidentally sent to Nintendo.
    
    AutoRCM has the following disadvantages:

    * You will not be able to boot your Switch at all without a payload sender.
    
    If you are downgrading, your fuse count will be incorrect for that firmware version. Because of this, **AutoRCM is required to boot your Switch** until you upgrade again.
    
    AutoRCM can always be disabled Hekate > Tools > AutoRCM
    
    .. tip::
        In the past, downgrading below your fuse count would mean you could no longer use sleep mode. This is no longer the case, as Hekate and Atmosphere both support sleep mode while downgraded.
   
.. note:: 
   This guide will allow you to recover your BIS keys if you do not already have them.

Step 0: Before Starting
-----------------------

1. You need a Windows PC capable of pushing payloads **(you NEED a Windows PC to follow this guide)**
2. You should have the latest version of Hekate and a working Hekate setup on your SD card. If you do not, follow `SD Card Setup (fusee-gelee) </hacking/fuseegelee/sdsetup>`_ and then return back to this page.
3. You need the firmware files for the firmware version you want to upgrade/downgrade to. These cannot be shared here as they are copyrighted.

    * You cannot use files for firmwares 6.2.0-9.1.0 as the ChoiDujour PC application does not support these versions. If you want to specifically upgrade/downgrade to one of these versions, you must first downgrade to any other firmware version and then upgrade to one of these versions using the ChoiDujourNX Switch application afterwards.
    
4. You need a fully populated hactool keys.txt file. These cannot be shared as doing so is illegal.
    
    * ChoiDujour is very picky about the keys file you use. If you have one generated from Lockpick or HACGUI, use that.

........

Step 1: Preparing Files
-------------------------------------------

1. Make sure your SD card includes a basic Hekate/Atmosphere setup (such as the one installed when following this guide)
2. Insert your SD card into your PC
3. Go to `switchtools.sshnuke.net <https://switchtools.sshnuke.net>`_
4. Download the latest version of **ChoiDujour (NOT ChoiDujourNX)** by rajkosto
5. Download the latest version of **HacDiskMount** by rajkosto
6. Download the latest version of **memloader** by rajkosto
7. Extract each downloaded .ZIP file to separate folders on your PC
8. Copy your hactool **keys.txt** into the ChoiDujour folder
9. Create a folder named **"fw"** inside of your ChoiDujour folder
10. Extract the contents of your firmware .ZIP file to the newly created **"fw"** folder
11. Go to `www.balena.io/etcher/ <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_, download and install Etcher for your system
12. In File Explorer, make sure Hidden Files are set to be shown

........

Step 2: Backing up your NAND
-------------------------------------------

By backing up your NAND (the Switch's internal memory), you will later be able to restore it in the event that anything goes wrong, essentially rewinding it back to a previous state.

**If anything goes wrong during this guide, you can always restore this backup with Hekate and restart**

1. Enter RCM and send the **"hekate-ctcaer-5.0.1.bin"** payload
2. In Hekate, select **'Tools > Backup eMMC > eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1'**
3. When finished, remove your SD card (you don't need to shutdown Hekate), insert it into your PC, and copy the 'backup' folder to a safe location on your PC. Afterwards, delete the 'backup' folder on your SD card.
4. Insert your SD card back into your Switch
5. In Hekate, select **'eMMC RAW GPP'**

    * If your SD card has less than ~32GB free space, Hekate will provide additional instructions every few minutes about pulling files off of your SD card so it can continue.

6. If you weren't required to copy files during the backup process, once again copy the 'backup' folder off of your SD card and put it in a safe location on your PC. Delete the 'backup' folder on your SD card.
7. Close the Backup menu, go back to the Home tab and tap **'Reboot > RCM'**

.. tip:: 
   It is highly recommended that you store these backups in multiple locations (ex. cloud storage, external harddrive, etc) as they may be critical to restoring your Switch if anything goes wrong in the future.
   
........
   
Step 3: Preparing SD card
-------------------------------------------

1. Insert your SD card into your PC
2. Navigate to where you extracted memloader earlier
3. Copy **the contents** of the **"/sample"** folder to the **root** of your SD card
4. Safely eject your SD card from your PC and put it into your Switch

........

Step 4: Converting Firmware Files
-------------------------------------------

1. Navigate to your ChoiDujour folder with File Explorer
2. In the address bar at the top, type **"cmd"** and press enter. A command prompt should open.

.. image:: https://puu.sh/C652v/857f93f5ed.png

3. In the command prompt, type **"ChoiDujour.exe \\-\\-keyset=keys.txt fw"** without quotes

    * If ChoiDujour says it cannot find firmware files or keys.txt, you likely put keys.txt or the firmware files in the wrong location. Try steps 1.9-1.12 again.
    * If the script fails otherwise, your keys.txt may be incompatible with ChoiDujour.

4. Once finished, you should see a message similar to **"All files verified! Prepared firmware update is in folder NX-X.X.X"** in the command prompt. Make sure you can find this folder, it will be used later.

........

Step 5: Transferring boot0 to your Switch
-------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
  
Step 14: First Launch Failed
---------------------------------------------------

.. warning::
    This next step is **only to be followed if your Switch did not boot during step 13.12 and you are trying to downgrade your Switch!** Do not follow it for any other reason.

If your Switch fails to launch during step 13, and you were trying to downgrade from a higher firmware version to a lower one, it is likely that there were incompatible changes made to system save data across firmware versions. Because of this, the only way to complete the downgrade is to wipe all system save data, **which will also delete all users, save data, installed games, and other system data.**
    
.. tip::
    If you want to keep your data and abort the downgrade, you must now restore the NAND backup you created in Step 2 through Hekate.
    
.. danger::
    If you understand that you will lose access to **all users, save data, installed games, and other system data.** and will want to complete the downgrade, proceed with the steps below.
    
.. danger::
    In this step, **NEVER NEVER EVER SELECT FORMAT DISK WHEN WINDOWS ASKS OR YOUR SWITCH WILL BRICK. Always select "Cancel".**
